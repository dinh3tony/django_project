			<p>Hi my name is Anthony, but every calls me Tony for some reason. It bugs me cause I prefer to be called by my given name from my parents. I have this stupid dog that no one likes called Bambi. I think he takes after me. I spent the last 10 years or so trying to snake my way into a this girl's pants but after a while that plan fell apart and I lost what little friends I had at the time. So here I am now looking for new friends to hang out and suck at games with. PS the girl in the picture is not my girlfriend, I tried snaking my way into her pants but she manhandled me.</p>
